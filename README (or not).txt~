What's Huffy? 
Huffy's a URL shortener, much like bit.ly or tinyurl, except the shortened path isn't made up of random characters, but gives some inkling as to the contents of URL. 

Fantastic! Is it going to replace bit.ly and tinyurl? 
Probably not for several iterations. Huffy's purpose so far is as a sample app for a Google App Engine tutorial I've written. You can check out the tutorial at www.randomcanary.com (and the hosted app at shorty-rc.appspot.com). 

However, do feel free to fork it off and improve it -  there's plenty to do here. Huffy scrapes and analyzes the URL's webpage, so there's ample room for improvement in both those areas (I'd first suggest going through the tut first so you know exactly what the code does right now). 
The code's also a great starting point for coding your own GAE-hosted webapp. If you end up playing with it, it would be nice if you forked it off - that way I know how many people it's helped.

PS Why “Huffy”? 
It's a reference to Huffman encoding. Huffy uses 10 characters to represent an entire webpage, so there's your analogy.
